# Building a Solidity Contract using ERC-20 contract requirements for Token Creation and Transfer:
## Follow code comments for notes and explanations.
This is a project to assist students with lots of comments within the code.  It explains the develepment of a basic ERC-20 contract that can create a Cryptocurrency Token and transfer tokens between accounts.
This project uses Remix and Hardhat to develop the Smart Contract with coding languages Solidity, JavaScript, and Ether.js. This project also implements test-driven development with tests for every functiontionality of the Smart Contract.  The tests were created using Hardhat's built-in testing capabilities with Mocha Test Runner, and the Chai testing library with Waffle.


## Basic Sample Hardhat Project Template

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
